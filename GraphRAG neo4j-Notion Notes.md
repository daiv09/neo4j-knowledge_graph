## Knowledge Graph

- Semantic network- Network of Real World Entities
- Example: Events, Concepts→ Also illustrates the relationship betweenthem
- Example:
    - New Delhi is the Capital of India.
    - Berlin is the Capital of Germany

## RDBMS vs Knowledge Graph

| RDBMS | Knowledge Graph |
| --- | --- |
| Tables | Graph |
| Insertion of Row | Insertion of Nodes |
| Columns and Data | Properties and Value |
| Constraints- Primary Key, Foreign Key, Candidate Key | Relationships between nodes |

# Neo4j
